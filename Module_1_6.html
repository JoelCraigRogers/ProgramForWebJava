    The CSS will be defined in the HTML file.  The browser will download the HTML and the CSS files and then render the page correctly. 
    A single CSS should work for the entire project. 
    Three CSS Methods:<br />
    1.  Inline - Style is defined at each element </br>
    The style attribute is defined at each element through the entire document. Can be easy to use if you only want to do something a single time.
    Can get cumbersome if you have multiple formats.  
    It can also get confusing having the style scattered around the doc. <br />
    2.  Internal - Defined in the head of each html file.<br />
    Applies through the entire document so it will be a little easier to manage. 
    It can still be complicated if you have a lot of pages to apply the style to.
    If you have a lot of styles the header can be very large. <br />
    3.  External (CSS) - styles are managed on a single location.  <br />

    Inline - Best for a single one off instance. 
    Disadvantages:
    Gets cumbersome mixing the content with the format

    Header - Good if you want a single page to be different
    Disadvantage - Can be difficult since you have to copy it to each page and change it with each update

    External - Seperate file and just uses a link for the in the head of each page. 
    Browser will request the CSS file and apply to the appropriate pages
    Will apply that style to all elements
